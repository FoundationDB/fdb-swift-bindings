/// Provides async sequence support for iterating over FoundationDB key-value ranges.
///
/// This file implements efficient streaming iteration over large result sets from FoundationDB
/// using Swift's AsyncSequence protocol with optimized background pre-fetching.

public extension Fdb {
    /// An asynchronous sequence that efficiently streams key-value pairs from FoundationDB.
    ///
    /// `AsyncKVSequence` provides a Swift-native way to iterate over large result sets from
    /// FoundationDB range queries without loading all data into memory at once. It implements
    /// background pre-fetching to minimize network latency and maximize throughput.
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let sequence = transaction.readRange(
    ///     beginSelector: .firstGreaterOrEqual("user:"),
    ///     endSelector: .firstGreaterOrEqual("user;")
    /// )
    ///
    /// for try await (key, value) in sequence {
    ///     let userId = String(bytes: key)
    ///     let userData = String(bytes: value)
    ///     // Process each key-value pair as it's received
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Performance Characteristics
    ///
    /// - **Streaming**: Results are processed as they arrive, not buffered entirely in memory
    /// - **Background Pre-fetching**: Next batch is fetched concurrently while processing current batch
    /// - **Configurable Batching**: Batch size can be tuned via `batchLimit` parameter
    /// - **Snapshot Consistency**: Supports both snapshot and non-snapshot reads
    ///
    /// ## Implementation Notes
    ///
    /// The sequence uses an optimized async iterator that:
    /// 1. Starts pre-fetching the next batch immediately upon initialization
    /// 2. Continues pre-fetching in background while serving current batch items
    /// 3. Only blocks when transitioning between batches if pre-fetch isn't complete
    ///
    /// This design minimizes the impact of network latency on iteration performance.
    struct AsyncKVSequence: AsyncSequence {
        public typealias Element = KeyValue

        /// The transaction used for range queries
        let transaction: ITransaction
        /// Starting key selector for the range
        let beginSelector: Fdb.KeySelector
        /// Ending key selector for the range (exclusive)
        let endSelector: Fdb.KeySelector
        /// Whether to use snapshot reads
        let snapshot: Bool
        /// Maximum number of key-value pairs to fetch per batch (0 = use FDB default)
        let batchLimit: Int = 0

        /// Creates a new async iterator for this sequence.
        ///
        /// The iterator begins background pre-fetching immediately upon creation to minimize
        /// latency for the first `next()` call.
        ///
        /// - Returns: A new `AsyncIterator` configured for this sequence
        public func makeAsyncIterator() -> AsyncIterator {
            AsyncIterator(
                transaction: transaction,
                beginSelector: beginSelector,
                endSelector: endSelector,
                snapshot: snapshot,
                batchLimit: batchLimit
            )
        }

        /// High-performance async iterator with background pre-fetching.
        ///
        /// This iterator implements an optimized batching strategy:
        ///
        /// 1. **Immediate Pre-fetch**: Starts fetching the first batch during initialization
        /// 2. **Background Pre-fetch**: While serving items from current batch, pre-fetches next batch
        /// 3. **Minimal Blocking**: Only blocks when current batch is exhausted and next isn't ready
        ///
        /// ## Performance Benefits
        ///
        /// - **Overlapped I/O**: Network requests happen concurrently with data processing
        /// - **Reduced Latency**: Pre-fetching hides network round-trip time
        /// - **Memory Efficient**: Only keeps 1-2 batches in memory at any time
        ///
        /// ## Thread Safety
        ///

        /// Multiple iterators can be created from the same sequence for concurrent processing.
