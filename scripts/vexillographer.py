This file provides logic for generating options code based on the fdb.options
file provided by FoundationDB.

To use Vexillographer, you must define an emitter. An emitter is a class that
provides language-specific implementations of the options syntax. The emitter
must define the following methods:

::

    class Emitter(object):
        def print_header_warning(self):
            # This method prints the warning at the top of the file that tells people
            # not to edit it by hand.

            pass

        def write_scope_start(self, name, signed):
            # This method writes the beginning of the type containing a kind of
            # option.

            # :param name: The name of the scope
            # :param signed: Whether these options can have negative values.

            pass

        def write_scope_end(self):
            # This method writes the end of the type containing a kind of option.

            pass

        def write_option(self, name, code, description, scope_name, deprecated):
            # This method writes a single option.
            #
            # :param scope_name: The name of the type that this option is part of.
            # :param name: The name of the option.
            # :param code: The numeric value for the option.
            # :param description: A comment describing the option.
            # :param deprecated: Whether the option has been deprecated.
            #

            pass

There are two ways you can run Vexillographer:

1.  Call :code:`Vexillographer.run`, passing a function that takes in a file
    object and returns an emitter for writing to that file. This will parse
    the standard arguments for Vexillographer and run the command to generate
    the file.
2.  Initialize a Vexillographer instance with an open file containing the
    options XML from fdb.options, and an emitter that will write to your output
    file. Then call :code:`write_file` on that Vexillographer instance.
